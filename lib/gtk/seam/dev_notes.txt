Now using a positive type list.  Generated from the html
documentation index by saving the list as txt in mozilla
and applying the following script on the generated file:
sed -n "s/^\(Gtk[^,]*\),.*$/\"\1\",/gp" < index.txt > GtkPositiveTypeList.sml

After that I just inserted val gtk_positive_type_list = [ ...original-content... ]

Added to GdkPositiveTypeList:
    GdkColorspace
    GdkInterpType

On my machine I also had to add the alice.dll to the link process:

Aka change:

%.dll: %.o
	$(ALICETOOL) -v link $< -o $@ \
	 $(CC_OPTS) `pkg-config --libs $(PC_OPTS)`

to:

%.dll: %.o
	$(ALICETOOL) -v link $< /home/dreamer/programming/ps/seam-install/lib/seam/alice.dll -o $@ \
	 $(CC_OPTS) `pkg-config --libs $(PC_OPTS)`

Otherwise loading the Gtk component would fail.
