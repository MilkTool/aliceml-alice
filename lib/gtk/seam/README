Installation instructions
=========================

To compile the GTK binding for Alice (SEAM) you need:
- the GTK+ 2.x libraries
- the GnomeCanvas library (libgnomecanvas)
- the pkgconfig utility

Let's assume you have installed the libraries and accompanying programs/files
into the directories /prefix/lib, /prefix/lib/pkgconfig, /prefix/bin, etc. 
(where "prefix" is usually "usr").

Now, set the GTK_PREFIX environment variable to "/prefix/"
(not to "/prefix/lib/"!)

Then execute the BUILD_ALL script in the binding directory.
This should build the whole binding, including sample files in the "samples"
directory.

Use "make distclean" to remove all files created during the build process.


To run Alice applications that use the GTK libraries, you may need to make
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or PATH (Windows) point to the location
of the libraries.
