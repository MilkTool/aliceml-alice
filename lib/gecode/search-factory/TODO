- Which exception is raised when "commit" is applied on a non-branching space ?
         => Patch TREENODE-sig and SPACENODE-sig

- Print each time a space is CLONED (and print the path).
- Use DEBUG !

- Implement a wrapper around "MkSpaceNode" or "MkTreeNode" that allows to use them with a simpler interface (when not BaBing).
