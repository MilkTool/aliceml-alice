Description: The Alice Programming System
 Alice is a functional programming language based on Standard ML, extended with
 support for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of Alice based on the Mozart virtual
 machine.  It includes an interpreter-like interactive toplevel, a batch
 compiler, a static linker, the Inspector (a tool for dynamically inspecting
 Alice data structures), the Explorer (a tool for interactively investigating
 search problems), a binding for the Gnome toolkit GUI library, and a
 comprehensive library.
 .
