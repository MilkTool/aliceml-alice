   <P>The <TT>MkEngine</TT> functor expects two arguments.
      The first one is a structure that provides the type of solutions of the distributed problem
      and a function <TT>toString</TT> to print them.
      The second one is a functor that creates a <A href="sf-problem.html"><TT>PROBLEM</TT></A>, given
      a local constraint library.</P>

         <TT><I>hostList</I></TT> is a list of pairs <I>(host, nickname)</I>,
         where <I>host</I> is the network name of the remote machine (where alice should be installed,
         see <A href="remote.html">Remote</A>),
         and <I>nickname</I> is a display name for that machine (for debug messages).

         <I>shutdown</I> is a function that can be used to concurrently stop the search and stop remote workers.
         <I>solutions</I> is a channel, initially empty, that is filled with solutions as soon as they are discovered.
