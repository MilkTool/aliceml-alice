<P>The virtual machine is required to execute Alice applications. It takes the

evaluates it.</P>

<P>Executes the application given by <I>&lt;url&gt;</I>, denoting a compiled
component. The component is located, loaded and evaluated using the root <A

be a Mozart component (<A

<P>The application can access the remaining command line arguments via the <A

To terminate an application, the <TT>OS.Process.terminate</TT> function must be
invoked. The virtual machine will <EM>not</EM> be terminated automatically,
even if no live threads are left.</P>

      <LI>If the URL uses the <TT>x-oz</TT> scheme, it is tried as-is,
	for compatibility with Oz.
      <LI>Otherwise, the URL is tried with the platform's default component
	extension appended, which is <TT>.ozf</TT>.
      <LI>If that fails, the URL is tried as-is, for compatibility

      <LI>If that fails, and <TT>ALICE_LOAD_SUFFIX</TT> is set, its methods
