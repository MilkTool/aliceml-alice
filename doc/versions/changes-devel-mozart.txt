Language:

* Nicer syntax (derived forms) for functors.
* Lazy and spawn syntax for modules.
* Pack can now use a transparent annotation, as this is usually more convenient.
* Fully dynamic component typing: link-time type checking now is fully
  parametric in abstract import types and takes into account the *dynamic*
  types exported by respective components. This implies at least two things:
  - Less need for recompilation. Recompilation of a component exporting
    abstract types no longer forces recompilation of dependent components.
  - Smooth interaction with pickles. Abstract types in compiled components are
    no longer incompatible with abstract types in pickled components.

Compiler:

* Dynamic sealing has been implemented.
* Warn about unused imports (switch --(no-)warn-unused-imports).
* Warn about inaccessible type and signature names appearing in inferred
  component signature (switch --(no-)warn-inaccessible-exports).
* Inaccessible types occuring in inferred /import/ signatures are now an error.
* To accommodate with the new dynamic import typing, the compiler now closes
  over all implicit import signatures, by potentially inserting additional
  imports for abstract types and signatures imported transitively. Optional
  warnings for added imports (switch --warn-added-imports).
* Support for smart recompilation, taking component signatures into account.

Linker:

* Rewritten to soundly support dynamic component typing.
* Disallow cyclic linking.
* Print free type names appearing in component signature with -d option.

Interactive Toplevel:

* Enable Ctrl-C for interrupting a computation.
* Enable Ctrl-Z for putting a computation into background (new Alice thread).
* Function exit() as an alternative for Ctrl-D in broken environments.
* Value printer is customizable for abstract types.

Library:

* Word32 added. LargeWord = Word32 now, but Word = Word31 remains.
* ComponentManager: added load function, and logStream reference to configure
  trace destinations. Preconfigurable through value of ALICE_TRACE_COMPONENT.
  Trace messages are more informative, particularly wrt signature mismatches.
  Also added exception Internal.
* Promise: fulfilling with a cycle no longer fails the promise.
* Alt: added mapBoth.
* Pair: added mapBoth.
* VectorSlice: fixed toVector.
* ByNeed: moved to Future structure.
* Future: added ByNeed and Concur functors.
* GlobalStamp: fixed toString.
* Channel: new module for concurrent message channels.
* Print: added function register for hooking user-defined printing functions.
* Remote: added functor Proxy to conveniently wrap a whole module into proxies.
* Gtk library: simplified structure, all types are now defined in GtkTypes.
