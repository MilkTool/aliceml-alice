We are happy to announce version 1.2 of the Alice programming
system:

     http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/alice/

Alice ML is a functional programming language that enriches the
statically typed, closed functional world of ML with extensive
support for type-safe programming of concurrent, distributed
and open systems. It also features cutting-edge constraint
programming technology in the tradition of Oz/Mozart.

Alice ML is a mostly conservative extension of Standard ML
featuring:

  Futures
     selective laziness and light-weight concurrency with
     implicit dataflow synchronisation
  Higher-order modules
     higher-order functors and abstract signatures
  Packages
     dynamically typed ML modules as first-class values
  Pickling
     type-safe, generic & platform-independent marshalling,
     including code, types and full modules
  Components
     type-safe lazy dynamic linking across the Internet
  Distribution
     type-safe remote functions and network mobility
  Constraints
     constraint propagation and programmable search for
     solving hard combinatorical problems
  Virtual Machine
     portable implementation with support for just-in-time
     compilation
  Interactive tools
     graphical browsers for data structures and search spaces

The highlights of this release are:

  Improvements to Interactive Toplevel
     Many improvements, tweaks and fixes in the GUI; new features include type
     tips, and native look&feel on Windows (thanks to Gtk Wimp theme).
  Overhaul of Constraint Library
     Many, many bug fixes in Gecode implementation and binding; simplified
     interface to set constraints.
  Experimental Byte Code Jitter
     Optimized byte code produced by jitting, which is at least twice as fast
     as non-jitted code; unlike native code jitting also available on PowerPC.
  Regular Expression Library
     A simple binding to GNU Regex library is included in the distribution.
  Bug Fixes
     Lots of bug fixes and minor improvements all over the place.
