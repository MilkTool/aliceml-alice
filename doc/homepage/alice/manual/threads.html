  <P>
    Alice provides concurrency as a fundamental language feature.
    The concurrency model is tightly coupled with
    <A href="futures.html">futures</A>.
    The basic primitive to create threads is available from the structure
    <A href="futures.html#future"><TT>Future</TT></A>:
  </P>

  <PRE>
	val concur : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
  </PRE>

  <P>
    It immediately returns a fresh future. The procedure will be applied
    in a new thread. When the application terminates the future is replaced
    with the result.
  </P>

  <P>
    Other operations on threads are provided through structure
    <A href="library/thread.html"><TT>Thread</TT></A>.
  </P>


<?php section("state", "state") ?>

  <P>
    To deal with state in a thread-safe way, the structure <TT>Ref</TT>
    provides an atomic exchange operation for references:
  </P>

  <PRE>
	val exchange : 'a ref * 'a -> 'a
  </PRE>

  <P>
    With <TT>exchange</TT>, the content of a cell can be
    replaced by a new value. The old value is returned. The <TT>exchange</TT>
    operation is atomic, and can thus be used for synchronisation.
    As an example, here is the implementation of a generic lock generator:
  </P>

  <PRE>
	(* mkLock : unit -> ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'b) *)

	fun mkLock() =
	    let
		val r = Ref.ref()
	    in
		fn f => fn x =>
		let
		    val new = Promise.promise()
		    val old = Ref.exchange(r, Promise.future new)
		in
		    await old;
		    f x before
		    Promise.fulfill(new, ()))
		end
	    end
  </PRE>
