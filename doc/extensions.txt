Core language:

+ binary literals
+ longids as context-free syntax

- var annotations in types?
- curried fn? (grammar overhead)
* more liberal infix syntax in fun
- more liberal datatype declaration syntax
+ punning in record expressions
- record update
+ vector constants and patterns
- list and vector comprehensions
* generalized rec
+ pattern guards
+ alternative patterns
- negated patterns?
+ generalized layered patterns
* nonlinear patterns? (better not, requires structural equality)

* overloaded literals?
* allow free type variables in strdecs
* polymorphic records
* open datatypes, turning exceptions into derived forms
* existiential types in datatypes
* specs as decs (semantics?)

Module language:

- parenthesized structure and signature expressions
- more liberal type specification syntax
- more liberal datatype specification syntax
+ withtype derived form in signatures
- open with structure expressions?
+ fixity specs (activated via open)

+ where for structures
* structure synonyms / singleton signatures / open in signatures (DF)
* signature composition
* signature subtraction
* parameterized signatures

* higher-order functors (functors in structures and signatures)
* longids as path expressions
* functor and top signatures
* first-class structures/functors (how??)
