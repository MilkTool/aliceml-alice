- don't use instance structures for runtime interfaces
- complete verifier for intermediate language
- remove indexed labels from signatures by converting hiding to local
- remove definitionals from signatures by adding singletons
- remove signature intersection
- make tuple special case of products/rows
- separate suspensions from applications
- separate types from type constructors
- separate types from type schemes (interferes with HO quantification needed
  in intermediate)
- get rid of 'con somehow
- make quantifications in interfaces explicit
- clean up VarDec stuff in elaborator
