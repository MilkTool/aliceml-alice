- make fixpoints explicit
- reconsider open types: probably as a special builtin type 'a <ext>;
  change syntax to exttype
- compress: integrate rehash-consing; use compress_state
- remove indexed labels from signatures by converting hiding to local
- remove definitionals from signatures by adding singletons
- remove signature intersection
- smarter handling of substitutions
- make tuple special case of products/rows
- separate suspensions from applications
- separate types from type constructors
- separate types from type schemes (interferes with HO quantification needed
  in intermediate)
- get rid of 'con somehow
- make quantifications in interfaces explicit
- clean up VarDec stuff in elaborator
- move PP stuff from lib/rtt to compiler/frontend-common
