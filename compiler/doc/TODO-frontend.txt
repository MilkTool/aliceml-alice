(* TODO-frontend.txt *)

General:

- Check for multiple imports from single (normalised) URL
- Improve pretty-printing
- Consistent state cleanup (especially on errors)

Documentation:

- Update compiler roadmap
- Intermediate language rationale
- Type language rationale

Missing from Standard Core Language:

- Equality types (equality is allowed on any type)
  [deferred until design on type classes is finished]
- Overloading (only defaults available)
  [deferred until design on type classes is finished]
- Checks for non-redundancy and exhaustiveness of matches

Missing from Standard Module Language:

- Include (no work-around)
  [might be translated into where expressions]

Missing from Extended Core Language:

- Specifications as declarations
  [how model them in elaboration rules?]
- Explicit quantification syntax
  [not difficult]
- Higher-kind type expressions and declarations, kind annotations
  [need to finalize design first]
- Existential constructors
  [not too useful without type classes]
- Universal constructors
  [deferred to be designed together with existential constructors]
- Type classes
  [design not finished]
- Polymorphic records, record composition
  [deferred until we have type classes]

Missing from Extended Module Language:

- Open in signatures
  [not difficult, but do we want it? (required for some derived forms);
   probably local specifications should contain declarations]
- Singleton signatures (can use manifest structures in most cases)
  [syntax? how do they colaborate with manifest structures?]
- Functor paths
  [how can they coexist with generative functors?]
- Full signature intersection
  [how treat conflicting dependencies?]
- Hiding / signature subtraction
  [worthwhile?]
- First-class modules
  [heavily messes up architecture of type checker]
