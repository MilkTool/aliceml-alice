TODO list for the Alice IDE
===========================

Bugs:

* output stream synchronisation (how?)
* paste should delete tags
* highlighting displaced due to prompt (ok?)
* jump-to-error does not work for compile
  (how do we detect whether we feeded something from a buffer or used
  the toplevel directly? We have to give eval a filename for buffers!)
* undo after open deletes buffer (ok?)
* scroll to bottom after layout change or resize
* propagate output width on init and after resize
* gui hangs when files are given on command line
* switch layout compiler and i/o buffer
* undo shortcut not shown in menu
* colorize compiler output?
* dialogues at mouse position
* about dialogue missing (ok?)

Missing Features:

* signal shortcuts (Ctrl-B, Ctrl-I?)
* shortcur for compile (Ctrl-K?)
* cumulative undo
* redo
* overwrapping search
* replace
* incremental search
* history
* general interactive highlighting
* auto-indentation, indent/outdent commands
