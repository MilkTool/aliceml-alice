TODO list for the Alice IDE
===========================

Bugs:

* jump to error does not work with compile
* search/goto dialogs should always be raised and moved to mouse position
* aliceglade ignores packing flags
  (manually replace alignment21's first Gtk.FILL by Gtk.EXPAND for text fields
   in search dialog to span full window)
* in/outdent shortcuts don't work on Windows (german keyboard)
* context menu doesn't display correctly (chinese Windows)
* Gtk.textIterFree produces segfaults, so at the moment it seems we can't properly free iterators :-(
* cannot assign .AML files to toplevel on Windows

* Reconsider implicit imports
* Proper treatment of relative import/cwd

Missing Features:

* completion
* detect file changes
* bookmarks?
* configure autoindent, tab expansion?
* propagate output width on init and after resize (requires Pango binding)
* comment/uncomment region?
* cumulative undo?
* redo?
* incremental search?
