TODO list for the Alice IDE
===========================

Bugs:

* jump-to-error does not work for compile
  (how do we detect whether we feeded something from a buffer or used
  the toplevel directly? We have to give eval a filename for buffers!)
* scroll to bottom after layout change or resize
* propagate output width on init and after resize
* pane resize upon opening first tab shrinks output pane to 0 size
* gui hangs when files are given on command line
* undo shortcut not shown in menu
* modified files dialogue is too ugly

Missing Features:

* signal shortcuts (Ctrl-B, Ctrl-I?)
* shortcut for compile (Ctrl-K?)
* shortcut for jump-to-error (Ctrl-E?)
* cumulative undo
* redo
* overwrapping search
* replace
* incremental search
* history
* general interactive highlighting
* auto-indentation, indent/outdent commands
