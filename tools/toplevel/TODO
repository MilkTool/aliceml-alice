TODO list for the Alice IDE
===========================

Bugs:

* Gtk.textIterFree produces segfaults, so at the moment it seems we can't properly free iterators :-(

Missing Features:

* propagate output width on init and after resize
* comment/uncomment region?
* cumulative undo?
* redo?
* incremental search?
* restricted search&replace in selected area (like Vi's :%s/foo/bar/g)?
* search & replace with regex (including \N in replacements)?
