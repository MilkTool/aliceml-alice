TODO list for the Alice IDE
===========================

Bugs:

* Indent-selection inserts whitespace at beginning of line, not before first
  character
* The output writers should be a little more robust against exceptions in
  e.g. the highlighting module - at the moment, an exception there just kills
  the output
* Reconsider implicit imports
* Feeding paragraph does not select initial whitespace on first line
* Cut&Paste with other apps
* Gtk.textIterFree produces segfaults, so at the moment it seems we can't properly free iterators :-(

Missing Features:

* bookmarks
* propagate output width on init and after resize (requires Pango binding)
* comment/uncomment region?
* cumulative undo?
* redo?
* incremental search?
